    <h1>Modules:</h1>
    <br>
    
    <h2>COM1001: Introduction to Software Engineering</h2>
    <p>
        In this module we use an object orientated language called Ruby, to produce some pretty interesting programs. One of which is the game Sokoban which I've managed to get some-what working in a Terminal. Also in this module, we work in groups of 7 along with a client; here we gather information about what the client wants and then produce it. These programms are much longer than individual projects.

    </p>
    <br>
    
    <h2>COM1002: Foundations of Computer Science</h2>
    <p>
        So far, this is my best achieveing module. Its main focus is on a branch of maths that I've never covered before, Discrete maths, where there are no longer numbers and some of the letters are upside-down. A link to this modules webpage can be found <a href="https://vle.shef.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/content/listContent.jsp?course_id=_45473_1&content_id=_1952604_1">here.</a>
    </p>
    <br>
    
    <h2>COM1003: Java Programming</h2>
    <p>
        In this module, we learn on thing... JAVA. This object-orientated language is extreamly powerful and I have already learnt so much about it. Java arrays are the bane of my life though. So far, in the assignements, we have managed to work out your weight depending on what planet in our solar system you're on and also a programme that produces a forrest on a graphics display.

    </p>
    <br>
    
    <h2>COM1005: Machines and Intellignece</h2>
    <p>
        This module focuses a lot on the history of A.I. and is really boring. But we must keep going as the end of year test is like 50% of the module. We do play with robots however, one can be seen to the right. They're pretty cool and also ridicuously expensive. A link to this modules webpage can be found <a href="https://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/R.Gaizauskas/campus_only/com1005/">here.</a>
    </p>
    <br>
    
    <h2>COM1006: Devices and Networks</h2>
    <p>
        This is the most challenging module of all, it involves besic things such as converting from binary to base 10, but then it somehow segways onto making and optimizing a CPU for a modern computer. This is too much for me and I'm dreading the end of year test. A link to this modules webpage can be found <a href="https://vle.shef.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/content/contentWrapper.jsp?content_id=_1952869_1&displayName=Module+web+page&course_id=_45476_1&navItem=content&href=https%3A%2F%2Fstaffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk%2Fpeople%2FD.Sudholt%2Fcampus_only%2Fcom1006%2F&cR2XilcGYOo=n%2BfPPwvyRckdbcE1iWl4wYL33hrSuwhSinLHIHrc5mo%3D">here.</a>
    </p>
    <br>
    
    <h2>COM1008: Web and Internet Technology</h2>
    <p>
        This has got to be, hands down, my favourite module. We have learnt about how to make webpages from scratch look good and function properly on modern browsers. Aside from that though, we have also learnt about internet security and some of the exploits there are in browsers.
